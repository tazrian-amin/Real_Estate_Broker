### `Details`

This is a Single Page Application (SPA) developed using latest technologies. Especially, we followed MERN stack to develop the fundamentals of this SPA. We used MongoDB database for storing our data. Basic CRUD operation was integrated which gave this website life. Moreover, JSON Web Token (JWT) was also used for user authorization. 

The website is about a Real Estate Broker who provides people buying and selling services. One can add a selling post, find a home to buy, see details about the house owner, add reviews upon user-login, update or delete his/her review, etc.
